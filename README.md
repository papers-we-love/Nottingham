# Nottingham 

This is the repository for the Nottingham chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/nottingham/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

We are a new chapter of Papers We Love based in Nottingham, UK. What was the last paper that really excited you? What was the last thing you read that changed he way you think about computer science? If you want to share your answers to these questions then please come along to our meetups. 

As a new group we are initially starting as a pub/coffee shop meet-up discussion group. We are organising ourselves via the [Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com) Slack and monthly meet up.
